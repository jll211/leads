Teams work together in context when CRM data, project management, and people all come together to solve problems and make decisions. Teams can talk to each other and their AI agent in conversational language, allowing them to access each other and information seamlessly. Slack AI recaps channels and summarizes threads so that employees can jump into discussion quickly, whether they are new to a project or catching up after being away.
